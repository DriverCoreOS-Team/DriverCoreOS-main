# üöò DriverCoreOS

**DriverCoreOS** is a modular, open-source in-car system designed to enhance vehicle telemetry, navigation, driving modes, media control, and more‚Äîtargeted at motorsport, enthusiast driving, and custom automotive setups.

> üß© Designed for **flexibility**, **extensibility**, and **hardware abstraction**, DriverCoreOS is composed of multiple components across ESP32 microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi interfaces, and a custom NixOS image for optimal boot-time and reproducibility.
